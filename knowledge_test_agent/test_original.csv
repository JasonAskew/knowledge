• A Strike Rate of 3.00%;
• A Notional Amount of $1,000,000.00;
• Quarterly Reset Dates; and
• BBSY as the Reference Rate.
In this example, it is assumed that you would pay us a non-refundable premium for the Cap.If BBSY sets above 3.00% on a Reset Date, we will compensate you for the difference between BBSY and the Strike Rate for the ensuing Calculation Period. For example, if BBSY sets at 3.50%, we will compensate you on the basis of a difference of 0.50% for the Calculation Period. The methodology used to calculate the payment under a Cap can be either a simple interest in arrears basis or on a discounted or bank bill basis.
Under a simple interest in arrears basis, the below formula is used to determine the amount payable to you.
Notional Amount x (R1-R2) x ND/365
Where:
R1: the Reference Rate
R2: the Strike Rate
ND: the number of days in the Calculation Period
Using the figures in the example, this is calculated as 
follows. Amount Payable to you:
$1,000,000 x (0.035-0.03) x 90/365=$1,232.88

8,BCG,PDS,WBC-InterestRateSwapPIS.pdf,Westpac,IRRM,Interest Rate Swap,How much will the coupon payments be? /  How are coupon payments calculated?,"The Fixed Rate Coupon Payments will be:
• Calculated using the same Fixed Rate each time; and
• Paid in arrears on each Payment Date (in respect of the period since the previous Payment Date, or the Commencement Date, as the case may be).The Floating Rate Coupon Payments may change each Payment Date. This is because the Floating Rate is variable and is set on each Reset Date for the period until the next Payment Date.If you choose to vary the Notional Amount during the Term of your IRS, your Coupon Payments for a particular interest rate period will be calculated on the Notional Amount for that interest rate period.
In each case, both your Fixed Rate Coupon Payment and your Floating Rate Coupon Payment can be calculated using the following formula:
A = B x C x (D/365)
Where:
A = your Coupon Payment;
B = your Notional Amount for that period;
C = either the Fixed Rate expressed as a percentage, or the Floating Rate expressed as a percentage, as determined on the preceding Reset Date (or the Commencement Date, as the case may be); and
D = the number of days since the previous Payment Date until (but excluding) the next Payment Date, or in the case of the first Payment Date, the number of days since the Commencement Date until (but excluding) the first Payment Date.
Please note that your Coupon Payments will not be compounded and cannot be reinvested in your IRS.There is no exchange of Notional Amount – only exchange of Coupon Payments Neither party to an IRS agrees to pay over the Notional Amount itself.

A CS shares many characteristics with a standard IRS and for this reason the features of an IRS are outlined below. The key difference between an IRS and a CS is our right to cancel the CS at pre-determined dates after the expiry of the Non-Call period. These callable dates are traditionally the payments dates and are set out at the Transaction Date.Where we elect to cancel the CS, the netting of the fixed and floating payments for that corresponding (and now final) period will be settled on the applicable payment date and there will be no further obligations for either party under the terms of the CS.

Not a protected Account.
The USD Tailored Deposit is classified as a Foreign currency deposit and is not protected by the Australian Governments’ Financial Claims scheme nor are they a ‘protected account’ under the Banking Act 1959 with the result that they do not receive preferred status over other unsecured creditors in the event of insolvency.

Applying an Early Withdrawal Adjustment may significantly reduce the return on your USD Tailored Deposit, and in some cases may result in the reduction of your Principal Balance. Please contact us if you have any questions on Early Withdrawal.
You may also request a variation to the terms of your USD Tailored Deposit before the end of the Term. If we, in our reasonable discretion, accept your request for variation, we may also apply an Early Withdrawal Adjustment to your USD Tailored Deposit.
See the sections titled ‘Will my return be impacted if I withdraw or vary the terms before the Maturity Date?’, ‘Notice Period’, and ‘Scenarios’ on pages 5 and 6 for more information. With these risks in mind, please consider your circumstances carefully when selecting the terms of your USD Tailored Deposit.
Counterparty and operational risk.
As is the case with most financial products we offer, we have performance obligations under a USD Tailored Deposit.
Our ability to fulfil our obligations is linked to our financial wellbeing and to the effectiveness of our internal systems, processes and procedures. The first type of risk (our financial wellbeing) is commonly referred to as credit or counterparty risk. The second type of risk (the effectiveness of our internal systems, processes and procedures) is commonly referred to as operational risk.
You must make your own assessment of our ability to meet our obligations. However, as a regulated Australian bank we are subject to prudential regulation which is intended to reduce the risk of us failing to perform our obligations.

Interest is paid as frequently as is agreed between yourself and Westpac, but usually either at maturity for terms of less than 12 months or monthly, quarterly, semi-annually or annually (in arrears) for terms of 12 months or greater.
Interest is calculated using the following formula:
Daily Closing Balance/365 x Fixed Interest Rate/100

An Early Withdrawal Adjustment can be broken into two factors; a Reduced Rate and a Replacement Cost.
The Reduced Rate will apply to the amount to be withdrawn for the actual period it was invested for. The impact of a Reduced Rate is an adjustment of the total amount of interest and is calculated by applying the difference between your original interest rate and the Reduced Rate (to the amount withdrawn) for the actual period of
your investment.
The Replacement Cost is determined by us in a commercially reasonable manner at the time of your request for Early Withdrawal with reference to:
1. current market interest rates at the time of your request;
2. the remaining applicable interest rate of your Deposit; and
3. the amount being withdrawn.
A Replacement Cost will only be applied if current market interest rates, based on the remaining Term from which you are withdrawing part or all of your Deposit, are greater than the interest rate remaining on your Deposit.
If in our discretion we agree to your request, you will receive a quote containing our calculations of the Reduced Rate and Replacement Cost and the proposed adjustment on the total amount of interest and principal (if applicable) applying to your Deposit (Early Withdrawal Adjustment). If you are satisfied with this quote, you will need to confirm your acceptance with our Representative.
Applying an Early Withdrawal Adjustment may significantly reduce the return on your Deposit, and in some cases may result in the reduction of your balance. With this in mind, please consider your circumstances carefully when selecting the terms of your Deposit.
No Early Withdrawal Adjustment will be applied if your Deposit is repaid prior to the Maturity Date due to your death or in the case of hardship ","WIBTD 24 April 2023, Page 6, ""Will my return be impacted if I withdraw before the Maturity Date?""",,

Westpac determines the Rate of Exchange for a Value Date taking several factors into account, including:
â€¢ the Currency Pair and the time zone you choose to 
trade in;
â€¢ the Value Date;
â€¢ Global Foreign Exchange Rates;
â€¢ the Contract Amount, and Westpacâ€™s inability to 
trade small amounts in the Global Market;
â€¢ market volatility;
â€¢ market interest rates of the countries of the Currency 
Pair; and
â€¢ Westpacâ€™s profit margins.
The Rate of Exchange for the First Leg of an FX Swap will depend on when settlement is to occur. If it occurs two business days after the Trade Date a Spot Exchange Rate will be applied. For all other dates an adjusted spot rate will be agreed with you.The difference between the Rate of Exchange on the First Leg of the FX Swap and the Rate of Exchange on the Second Leg of the FX Swap is referred to as the Swap Margin. It will reflect the difference in inter-bank interest rates between the currencies that make up the Currency Pair.The Swap Margin does not represent a forecast that Westpac has made for the term of the FX Swap contract, nor does it infer what future exchange rates will be.A Swap Margin can be either a positive or a negative number. When a Swap Margin is a positive number, it is added to the Rate of Exchange applied to the First Leg of the FX Swap in order to determine the Rate of Exchange that will be applied to the Second Leg; when it is a negative number, it is subtracted from the Rate of Exchange applied to the First Leg.
In specific situations you may request us to set the Rate of Exchange that is applied to either the First Legor the Second Leg of an FX Swap at a particular rate 
so that it matches the Rate of Exchange on an existing FX transaction that you have in place. If we agree to your request we will provide you with a Swap Margin 
based on the agreed Rate of Exchange. We will not always agree to do this and as part of this process may require you to sign our Historical rate rollover

The following summary outlines what we consider to be the primary risks of the product, but is not intended to be exhaustive as to all the possible risks.

Currency Conversion.
You may receive the Alternate Currency at Maturity. It is important that you are comfortable receiving either the Investment Currency or the Alternate Currency.

Exchange Rate Risk.
Whether you receive the principal and interest in one of two currencies is linked to the exchange rate for the underlying currency pair. i.e. you bear the risk of exchange 
rate movements between the Investment Currency and the Alternate Currency.
This may result in:
Conversion rate risk â€“ if you wish to exchange the Investment Currency for the Alternate Currency at Maturity, the market exchange rate available at that time may be 
less favourable than the market exchange rate that was available to you at the start of the DCI.

Opportunity risk on conversion â€“ if you wish to exchange the Investment Currency for the Alternate Currency at Maturity and your DCI repays in the Alternate Currency, the 
redemption rate you convert at will be less favourable than the market exchange rate otherwise available to you at that time.
Potential capital loss at maturity â€“ A DCI is not capital protected in the terms of the Investment Currency. This means if you receive the Alternate Currency at Maturity and 
you were to convert it into the Investment Currency at the market rate at that time, the amount that you would receive may be less than your initial Investment Amount.
Early Withdrawal Risk.
A DCI is designed to be held to maturity. If you request an early withdrawal of your principal there may be a cost involved. See section â€˜Early Terminationâ€™ on page 6. The 
termination amount you receive will be a function of the same variables used to price the original DCI. Movements in those variables, in particular the exchange rate, are outside 
the control of us. There are no additional termination fees.
Counterparty and Operational Risk.
As is the case with most financial products we offer, we have performance obligations under a DCI.Our ability to fulfil our obligations is linked to our financial wellbeing and to the effectiveness of our internal systems, processes and procedures. The first type of risk (our financial wellbeing) is commonly referred to as credit or counterparty risk. The second type of risk (the effectiveness of our internal systems, processes and procedures) is commonly referred to as operational risk.
You must make your own assessment of our ability to meet our obligations. However, as a regulated Australian bank, we are subject to prudential regulation which is intended to 
reduce the risk of us failing to perform our obligations.","BSA-DualCurrencyInvestmentPIS.pdf, pg. 3, ""Potential for Higher Interest Rate"" and pg. 4 for ""Risks""",,

Level to be 0.6600.The possible outcomes on the Maturity Date are:
a) if the Release Level has not been reached at any time during the term of the EFC, you must exchange your AUD at the Contract Rate of 0.6645. You will pay: AUD 150,489.09(= USD 100,000 / 0.6645)
